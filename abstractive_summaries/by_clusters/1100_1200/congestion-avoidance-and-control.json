conserving equilibrium through management of RTT variability to avoid too many retransmissions; and adapting the path by throttling back sources under in-network congestion.", "Slow Start  Once a connection is up and running acks can regulate a \u2018clock\u2019 that stops packets being sent too quickly for the receiver, since acks can\u2019t be generated any faster than packets can get through the network.", "But how do you get the data flowing in the first place?", "To start the `clock\u2019, we developed a slow-start algorithm to gradually increase the amount of data in-transit.", "Although we flatter ourselves that the design of this algorithm is rather subtle, the implementation is trivial\u2014one new state variable and three lines of code in the sender:  Add a congestion window, cwnd, to the per-connection state.", "When starting or restarting after a loss, set cwnd to one packet.", "On each ack for newdata, increase cwnd by one packet.", "When sending, send the minimum of receiver\u2019s advertised window and cwnd.", "Actually, the slow-start window increase isn\u2019 t that slow: it takes time R log2W where R is the round-trip-time and W is the window size in packets.", "This means the window opens quickly enough to have a negligible effect on performance, even on links with a large bandwidth\u2013delay product.", "Retransmissions (retries)  A good round trip time estimator, the core of the retransmit timer, is the single most important feature of any protocol implementation that expects to survive heavy load.", "And it is frequently botched\u2026One mistake is not estimating the variation of the round trip time, R .", "From queuing theory we know that R and the variation in R increase quickly with load.", "See the details in appendix A of the paper for a cheap to compute variation estimator (prior versions of the TCP specification recommended a constant value to use), which can then be used to update the retransmit timeout operator for the next packet sent.", "Another timer mistake is in the backoff after a retransmit: If a packet has to be retransmitted more than once, how should the retransmits be spaced?", "For a transport endpoint embedded in a network of unknown topology and with an unknown, unknowable and constantly changing population of competing conversations, only one scheme has any hope of working\u2014exponential backoff\u2014but a proof of this is beyond the scope of this paper.", "It\u2019s all to do with linear system theory apparently:  Linear system theory says that if a system is stable, the stability is exponential.", "This suggests that an unstable system (a network subject to random load shocks and prone to congestive collapse can be stabilized by adding some exponential damping (exponential timer backoff) to its primary excitation (senders, traffic sources).", "Congestion management  If timeouts are set appropriately as above, then timeouts will be due to lost packets.", "Packets could be damaged in transit (comparatively rare), or dropped due to congestion in the network.", "Therefore we can assume that timeouts are a good proxy sign for network congestion.", "The network must be able to signal the transport endpoints that congestion is occurring (or about to occur).", "And the endpoints must have a policy that decreases utilization if this signal is received and increases utilization if the signal isn\u2019 t received.", "We can use timeouts as the signal, but what shoud the policy be?", "When the network is congested\u2026 the queue lengths will start increasing exponentially.", "The system will stabilize only if the traffic sources throttle back at least as quickly as the queues are growing.", "Load is controlled by adjusting the size of the window.", "So when congestion is signalled the window  is resized to d.W, where d is a constant   The first thought is to use a symmetric, multiplicative increase, possibly with a longer time constant,  Wi = bWi-1 where 1 < b < 1/d .", "This is a mistake.", "The result will oscillate wildly and, on the average, deliver poor throughput.", "The best increase policy is to make small, constant changes to the window size: Wi = Wi-1 + u.", "We end up with the following simple implementation:  On any timeout, set cwnd to half the current window size (this is the multiplicative decrease).", "On each ack for new data, increase cwnd by 1/cwnd (this is the additive increase).", "When sending, send the minimum of the receiver\u2019 s advertised window and cwnd."], "author_id": "ACOLYER", "pdf_url": "http://ee.lbl.gov/papers/congavoid.pdf", "author_full_name": "Adrian Colyer", "source_website": "https://blog.acolyer.org/about/", "id": 8151447}
