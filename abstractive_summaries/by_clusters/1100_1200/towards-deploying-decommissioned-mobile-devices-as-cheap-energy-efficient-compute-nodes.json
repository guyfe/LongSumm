shaving the peak power under high utilization, while storing energy under low utilization.", "The high energy storage density enables more aggressive power capping of servers that are filled with used mobile devices.", "Even assuming 15% battery degradation per year, the capacity will be 4-8x denser than purpose designed distributed UPS solutions.", "Is it cost effective?", "We\u2019ve seen that in theory racks of decommissioned mobile devices can be done, and we\u2019ve seen that there are some potential use cases for such systems.", "But does it make financial sense??", "The authors choose the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 as a representative three-year old device, and match it against a Lenovo Flex System x880 X6 which has similar performance as 84 Note 4s.", "CAPEX and OPEX work out as follows (the authors assumed that the monitoring engineering, and installation cost of the mobile array is twice that of a standard server):  A TCO analysis shows that the mobile array beats the traditional server on TCO by some margin.", "(In the figures below \u2018A\u2019 is the traditional server, \u2018B\u2019 is the mobile array, and &delta;
