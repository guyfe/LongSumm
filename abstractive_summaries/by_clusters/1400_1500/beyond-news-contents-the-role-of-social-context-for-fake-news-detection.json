There\u2019s one last thing at our disposal: a labelled dataset for news articles telling us whether they are fake or not.", "(Here we have just the news article content, not the social context).", "The Tri-relationship embedding framework  TriFN takes all of those inputs and combines them with a fake news binary classifier.", "Given lots of users and lots of news articles, we can expect some of the raw inputs to be pretty big, so the authors make heavy use of dimensionality reduction using non-negative matrix factorisation to learn latent space embeddings (more on that in a minute!)", "TriFN combines:  A news content embedding  A user embedding  A user-news interaction embedding  A publisher-news interaction embedding, and  The prediction made by a linear classifier trained on the labelled fake news dataset  Pictorially it looks like this (with apologies for the poor resolution, which is an artefact of the original):  News content embedding  Let\u2019s take a closer look at non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) to see how this works to reduce dimensionality.", "Remember the bag-of-words sketch for news articles?", "That\u2019s an n x t matrix where n is the number of news articles and t is the number of words in the vocabulary.", "NMF tries to learn a latent embedding that captures the information in the matrix in a much smaller space.", "In the general form NMF seeks to factor a (non-negative) matrix M into the product of two (non-negative) matrices W and H (or D and V as used in this paper).", "How does that help us?", "We can pick some dimension d (controlling the size of the latent space) and break down the  matrix into a d-dimension representation of news articles  , and a d-dimension representation of words in the vocabulary,  .", "That means that  has shape  and so  ends up with the desired shape  .", "Once we\u2019ve learned a good representation of news articles,  we can use those as the news content embeddings within TriFN.", "We\u2019d like to get  as close to  as we can, and at the same time keep  and  \u2018sensible\u2019 to avoid over-fitting.", "We can do that with a regularisation term.", "So the overall optimisation problem looks like this:  User embedding  For the user embedding there\u2019s a similar application of NMF, but in this case we\u2019re splitting the adjacency matrix  into a user latent matrix  , and a user correlation matrix  .", "So in this case we\u2019re using NMF to learn  which has shape mxd .", "dxd .", "dxm, resulting in the desired mxm shape.", "There\u2019s also a user-user relation matrix  which  controls the contribution of  .", "The basic idea is that any given user will only share a small fraction of news articles, so a positive case (having shared an article) should have more weight than a negative case (not having shared).", "User-news interaction embedding  For the user-news interaction embedding we want to capture the relationship between user features and the labels of news items.", "The intuition is that users with low credibility are more likely to spread fake news.", "So how do we get user credibility?", "Following \u2018 Measuring user credibility in social media \u2019 the authors base this on similarity to other users.", "First users are clustered into groups such that members of the same cluster all tend to share the same news stories.", "Then each cluster is given a credibility score based on its relative size.", "Users take on the credibility score of the cluster they belong to.", "It all seems rather vulnerable to the creation of large numbers of fake bot accounts that collaborate to spread fake news if you ask me.", "Nevertheless, assuming we have reliable credibility scores then we want to set things up such that the latent features of high-credibility users are close to true news, and the latent features of low-credibility users are close to fake news.", "Publisher-news embeddings  Recall we have the matrix  encoding which publishers have published which news pieces.", "Let  be the normalised version of the same.", "We want to find  , a weighting matrix mapping news publisher\u2019s latent features to the corresponding partisan label vector  .", "It looks like this:  Semi-supervised linear classifier  Using the labelled data available, we also learn a weighting matrix  mapping news latent features to

all of the learned matrices.", "It looks like this:  and it\u2019s trained like this:  Evaluation  TriFN is evaluated against several state of the art fake news detection methods using the FakeNewsNet
