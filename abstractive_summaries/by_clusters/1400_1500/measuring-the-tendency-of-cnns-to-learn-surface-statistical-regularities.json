Here are some example images from the SVHN dataset (top row), and the results of applying the radial and random masking filters respectively:  And this is the same thing, but for the CIFAR-10 dataset:  The filters do introduce artifacts into the images, but these don\u2019t really interfere with human perception, and tend to occur in the background of the image.", "Running the experiment  For both the CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets the authors use some established high-performance CNN architectures (Preact ResNet).", "A model is trained on one of the unfiltered, radial mask, or random mask datasets, and then tested across all three test groups (unfiltered, radial, random).", "This enables us to measure the test gap or generalisation gap as the maximum difference in accuracy across the test sets.", "For the SVHN source dataset, the three figures below show the generalisation results after training on (a) unfiltered, (b) random, and (c) radial.", "And here\u2019s the same thing for CIFAR-10:  With SVHN the largest generalisation gap (7.89%) occurs when training on randomly filtered data, and testing on the radially filtered dataset.", "Training on the radially filtered dataset actually turned out to improve generalisation performance on the unfiltered test set by 1.5%.", "The authors put this down to a regularisation effect.", "Changing the network depth seemed to have little impact on the generalisation gap.", "That is, there is no evidence of an ability to more successfully learn higher level abstractions when we add more data.", "With CIFAR-10 the generalisation gaps are bigger: 28% when trained on randomly filtered data tested on radially filtered.", "Changing the depth has little impact in this case too.", "Discussion  In addition to still being recognisable to the human eye (a subjective measure), we know also know that networks trained on the filtered datasets actually generalised quite well to the unfiltered test set (off by 1-2% of the best unfiltered accuracy).", "This provides further evidence that the choice of Fourier filtering schemes is producing datasets that are perceptually not too far off from the original unfiltered dataset.", "We see that deep CNNs trained on a unfiltered natural image dataset exhibit a tendency to latch onto the image statistics of the training set, yielding a non-trivial generalization gap\u2026  When training on all three training sets (unfiltered, radial, and random) there is an improvement in the generalisation gap.", "\u201cHowever, we cast doubt on the notion that this sort of data augmentation scheme is sufficient to learn higher level semantic features in the dataset.", "Rather it is far more likely that the CNNs are learning a superficial robustness to the varying image statistics.\u201d  Overall, the data seems to support the initial hypothesis: \u201cthe current incarnation of deep neural networks have a tendency to learn surface statistical regularities as opposed to high level abstractions.\u201d  What are we to do?", "I\u2019m reminded of the brightly coloured word books we teach our children with \u2013 often with a single strong cartoon-like image of an object, on a plain white background, and the label (word) underneath.", "By seeing real world objects with movement (either of our own point of view, or because they have independent motion) we are also forced to more strongly separate object from background.", "The authors cite six pieces of work which they believe represent promising new directions:  \u201c Independently controllable factors \u201d and \u201c Reinforcement learning with unsupervised auxiliary tasks \u201d aim to learn good disentangled feature representations by combining unsupervised and reinforcement learning.", "\u201c SCAN: learning abstract hierarchical compositional visual concepts \u201d uses a variational setup.", "\u201c Discovering objects and their relations from untangled scene representations \u201d aims to learn abstract relations between objects in natural scene images  \u201c The consciousness prior \u201d moves away from making predictions in the perceptual space, and instead operates in the higher-order abstract space."], "author_id": "ACOLYER", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.11561", "author_full_name": "Adrian Colyer", "source_website": "https://blog.acolyer.org/about/", "id": 23942242}
