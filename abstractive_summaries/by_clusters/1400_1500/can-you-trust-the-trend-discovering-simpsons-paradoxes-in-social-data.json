shows how you can detect instances of Simpson\u2019s paradox, thus revealing the presence of interesting subgroups, and hopefully avoid drawing the wrong conclusions.", "For the evaluation part of the work, the authors look at question-answering on Stack Exchange (Stack Overflow, for many readers of this blog I suspect).", "We investigate how Simpson\u2019s paradox affects analysis of trends in social data.", "According to the paradox, the trends observed in data that has been aggregated over an entire population may be different from, and even opposite to, those of the underlying subgroups.", "Let\u2019s jump straight to an example.", "In Stack Exchange someone posts a question and other users of the system post answers (ignoring the part about the question first being deemed worthy of the forum by the powers-that-be).", "Users can vote for answers that they find helpful, and the original poster of the question can accept one of the answers as the best one.", "What factors influence whether or not a particular answer is accepted as the best one?", "One of the variables that has been studied here is when in a user\u2019s session an answer is posted.", "Suppose I\u2019m feeling particularly helpful today, and I log onto to Stack Overflow and start answering questions to the best of my ability.", "I answer one question, then another, then another.", "Is my answer to the first question more or less likely to be accepted as a best answer than my answer to the third question?", "If we look at the data from 9.6M Stack Exchange questions, we see the following trend:  It seems that the more questions I\u2019ve previously answered in a given session, the greater the probability my next answer will be accepted as the best one!", "That seems a bit odd.", "Do question answerers get into the flow?", "Do they start picking \u2018easier\u2019 questions (for them) as the session goes on?", "Here\u2019s another plot of exactly the same dataset, but with the data disaggregated by session length.", "Each different coloured line represents a session of a different length (i.e., sessions where the user answered only one question, sessions where the user answered two questions, and so on).", "When we compare sessions of the same length, we clearly see exactly the opposite trend: answers later in a session tend to fare worse than earlier ones!", "The truth is that \u201ceach successive answer posted during a session by a user on Stack Exchange is shorter, less well documented with external links and code, and less likely to be accepted by the asker as the best answer.\u201d  When measuring how an outcome changes as a function of an independent variable, the characteristics of the population over which the trend is measured may change as a function of the independent variable due to survivor bias.", "To illustrate, here\u2019s an example of that Stack Exchange data broken down by session length.", "Note the massive class imbalances (many more sessions of length one than length eight for example).", "When calculating acceptance probability for the aggregate data, consider the case of computing the probability that the third answer in a session is accepted as the best one.", "Of the 12.8M total data points, 9.6M of them aren\u2019t eligible to contribute to this analysis (sessions of length one or two).", "Thus there is a survivorship bias \u2013 when we get to the third answer, the first two have already failed to be accepted, indicating that perhaps the new answer is facing weaker competition.", "This increases the probability that the third answer will be accepted as the best.", "(And so on, as session lengths get longer and longer).", "\u2026 despite accumulating evidence that Simpson\u2019s paradox affects inference of trends in social and behavioral data, researchers do not routinely test for it in their studies.", "Identifying Simpson\u2019s paradoxes  We\u2019d like to know if a Simpson\u2019s paradox exists so that we don\u2019t draw the wrong conclusions, and also because it normally suggests something interesting happening in the data: subgroups of the population which differ in their behaviour in ways which are significant enough to affect aggregate trends.", "We propose a method to systematically uncover Simpson\u2019s paradox for trends in data.", "Let Y be the outcome being measured (e.g., the probability than an answer is accepted as the best one), and  be the set of m independent variables or features (e.g, the reputation of the answering user, the number of answers so
