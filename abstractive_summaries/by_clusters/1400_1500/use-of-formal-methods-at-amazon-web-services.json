the code faithfully implements the intended design, but the design fails to correctly handle a particular \u2018rare\u2019 scenario.", "Finding a precise design language  In order to find subtle bugs in a system design, it is necessary to have a precise description of that design.", "There are at least two major benefits to writing a precise design; the author is forced to think more clearly, which helps eliminate \u2018plausible hand-waving\u2019, and tools can be applied to check for errors in the design, even while it is being written.", "AWS needed a precise design language, but also a pragmatic one:  As our designs are unavoidably complex, we needed a highly expressive language, far above the level of code, but with precise semantics.", "That expressivity must cover real-world concurrency and fault-tolerance.", "And, as we wish to build services quickly, we wanted a language that is simple to learn and apply, avoiding esoteric concepts.", "We also very much wanted an existing ecosystem of tools.", "They \u2018found what we were looking for in TLA+, a formal specification language.\u2019  Benefits  TLA+ helped AWS find subtle bugs in S3, DynamoDB, EBS, and an internal distributed lock manager, as well as verifying several optimizations.", "The effects go deeper than just finding bugs though.", "TLA+ has been helping us shift to a better way of designing systems.", "The process begins by stating clearly \u2018what needs to go right?\u2019 by defining correctness properties.", "Safety properties define what the system is allowed to do, and liveness properties define what the system must eventually do.", "The benefits are not just in the initial system design, but over the lifetime of the system.", "We have found that writing a formal specification pays several dividends over the lifetime of the system.", "All production services at Amazon are under constant development, even those released years ago; we add new features that customers have requested, we re-design components to handle massive increases in scale, and we improve performance by removing bottlenecks.", "Many of these changes are complex, and they must be made to the running system with no downtime.", "Our first priority is always to avoid causing bugs in a production system, so we often need to answer the question, \u201cis this change safe?\u201d We have found that a major benefit of having a precise, testable model of the core system is that we can rapidly verify that even deep changes are safe, or learn that they are unsafe without doing any harm.", "In several cases we have prevented subtle, serious bugs from reaching production.", "In other cases we have been able to make innovative performance optimizations \u2013 e.g. removing or narrowing locks, or weakening constraints on message ordering \u2013 which we would not have dared to do without having model checked those changes.", "Spreading the word  Success breeds success, but it\u2019s best not to scare people off too early:  \u2026we have found that software engineers more readily grasp the concept and practical value of TLA+ if we dub it: exhaustively testable pseudo-code.", "We initially avoid the words \u2018formal\u2019, \u2018verification\u2019, and \u2018proof\u2019, due to the widespread view that formal methods are impractical.", "Formal methods seem to be becoming an important part of the AWS processes:  At AWS, formal methods have been a big success.", "They have helped us prevent subtle, serious bugs from reaching production, bugs that we would not have found via any other technique.", "They have helped us to make aggressive optimizations to complex algorithms without sacrificing quality.", "So far, seven teams have used TLA+, and all have found high value in doing so.", "At the time of writing, more teams are starting to use TLA+.", "We believe that use of TLA+ will accelerate both time-to-market and quality of these projects.", "Executive management is now proactively encouraging teams to write TLA+ specs for new features and other significant design changes.", "In annual planning, managers are now allocating engineering time to use TLA+.", "Summary  It\u2019s great to see the value of formal methods being recognised once more.", "This paper is also a good insight into the distributed systems design methodology at AWS.", "It adds another dimension to AWS\u2019s challenge to the rest of the industry: keep up if you can!"], "author_id": "ACOLYER", "pdf_url": "http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/formal-methods-amazon.pdf", "author_full_name": "Adrian Colyer", "source_website": "https://blog.acolyer.org/about/", "id": 93025332}
