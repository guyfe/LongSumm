Solving the above equation is computationally infeasible and an approximate solution is proposed using eigenvalues and matrices.", "The approximate solution is easy to implement, efficient and guaranteed to find clusters that are at most a quadratic factor away from the optimal.", "Algorithm  Given the network and motif M, form a motif adjacency matrix WM where WM(i, j) is the number of instances of M that contains i and j.
