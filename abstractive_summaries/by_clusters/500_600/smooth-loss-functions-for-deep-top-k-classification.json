Its weak derivatives have at most 2-nonzero elements.", "The loss can be reformulated by adding and subtracting the k-1 largest scores of s\\y and sy and by introducing a temperature parameter \u03c4.", "Properties of Lk\u03c4  For any \u03c4 > 0, Lk\u03c4 is infinite-differentiable and has non-sparse gradients.", "Under mild conditions, Lk\u03c4 apporachs lk (in a pointwise sense) as \u03c4 approaches to 0++.", "It is an upper bound on the actual loss (up to a constant factor).", "It is a generalization of the cross-entropy loss for different values of k, and \u03c4 and higher margins.", "Computational Challenges  nCk number of terms needs to be evaluated for computing the loss for one sample (n is number of classes).", "Loss Lk\u03c4 can be expressed in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials \u03c3i(e) (sum of all products of i distinct elements of vector e).", "Thus the challenge is to compute \u03c3k efficiently.", "Forward Computation  Compute \u03c3k(e) where e is a n-dimensional vector and k\u00ab\u00a0n and e[i]!=0 for all i.  \u03c3i(e) can be computed using the coefficients of the polynomial (X+e1)(X+e2)\u2026(X+en) by divide and conquer approach with polynomial multiplication.", "With some more optimizations (eg log(n) levels of recursion and each level being parallelized on a GPU), the resulting algorithms scale well with n on a GPU.", "Operations are performed in the log-space using the log-sum-exp trick to achieve numerical stability in single floating point precision.", "Backward computation  The backward pass uses optimizations like computing derivative of \u03c3j with respect to ei in a recursive manner.", "Appendix of the paper describes these techniques in detail.", "Experiments  Experiments are performed on CIFAR-100 (with noise) and Imagenet.", "For CIFAR-100 with noise, the labels are randomized with probability p (within the same top-level class).", "The proposed loss function is very robust to both noise and reduction in the amount of training dataset as compared to cross-entropy loss function for both top-k and top-1 performance."], "author_id": "shugan", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.00420", "author_full_name": "Shagun Sodhani", "source_website": "https://github.com/shagunsodhani/papers-I-read", "id": 26955055}
