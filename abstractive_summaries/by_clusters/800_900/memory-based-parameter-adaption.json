The parameters of the output network g are adapted from \u03b8 to \u03b8x where \u03b8x = \u03b8 + \u03b4M(x, \u03b8)  \u03b4M(x, \u03b8) is referred to as the contextual update of parameters of the output network.", "Interpretation of MbPA  MbPA can be interpreted as decreasing the weighted average of negative log likelihood over the retrieved neighbours in the context C.  The expression corresponding to  \u03b4M(x, \u03b8) can be obtained by performing gradient descent to minimise the max a posterior over the context C.  The a posterior expression can be written as a sum of two terms - one corresponding to a weighted likelihood of data in the context C and the other corresponding to a regularisation term to prevent overfitting the data.", "This idea can be thought of as a generalisation of attention.", "Attention can be viewed as fitting a constant function over the neighbourhood of memories while MbPA fits a more general function which is parameterised by the output network of the given model.", "Refer appendix E in the paper for further details.", "Experiments  MbPA aims to solve the fundamental problem of enabling the model to deal with changes in data distribution.", "In that sense, it is evaluated on a wide range of settings: continual learning, incremental learning, unbalanced datasets and change in data distribution at test time.", "Continual Learning:  In this setting, the model encounters a sequence of tasks and cannot revisit a previous task.", "Permuted MNIST dataset was used.", "The key takeaway is that once a task is catastrophically forgotten, only a few gradient updates on a carefully selected data, are sufficient to recover the performance.", "Incremental Learning:  In this setting, the model is trained on a subset of classes and then introduced to novel, unseen classes.", "The model is tested to see if it can incorporate the new knowledge while retaining the knowledge about the previous classes.", "Imagenet dataset with Resnet V1 model is used.", "It is first pretrained on 500 classes and then fine-tuned to see how quickly could it adapt to new classes.", "Unbalanced Dataset:  This setting is similar to the incremental learning setting with the key difference that once the model has been trained on a part of the dataset and is to be finetuned to acquire new knowledge, the dataset used for finetuning is much smaller than the initial dataset thus creating the effect of unbalanced datasets.", "Language Modelling:  MbPA is used to adapt to the shift in the word distribution that is common to language modelling tasks.", "PTB and WikiText datasets were used.", "MbPA exhibits strong performance on all these tasks showing that the memory-based parameter adaption technique is effective across a range of tasks in supervised learning."], "author_id": "shugan", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.10542", "author_full_name": "Shagun Sodhani", "source_website": "https://github.com/shagunsodhani/papers-I-read", "id": 79471009}
