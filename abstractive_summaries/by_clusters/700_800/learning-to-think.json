{"blog_id": "learning-to-think", "summary": ["This article presents a roadmap for future progress in developing machines that can learn and \u201cthink\u201d like humans.", "The authors outline a number of ideas that they believe are crucial to making progress in artificial intelligence.", "A short-term goal of the authors is to improve today\u2019s machine learning techniques so that complex concepts can be learned quickly with only small amounts of data.", "Currently, our algorithms require ungainly amounts of data and computation to perform at acceptable levels.", "The authors argue that a marriage of two distinct research areas in artificial intelligence, that of statistical pattern recognition and of model-building, will produce a promising avenue for new advances.", "Specifically, the authors suggest that learning as a form of explaining observed data by the construction of causal models of the world can be accomplished by deep neural networks.", "The first causal model that is discussed is dubbed intuitive physics.", "That is, a machine with an internal model of the physics of its environment is able to learn more quickly than without.", "This is because the machine will not need to re-learn basic physics principles when attempting to learn new tasks that require it.", "The second causal model is intuitive psychology.", "A learning agent that assumes that other agents in its environment are rational and have their own goals and beliefs can try to infer what these may be.", "Having knowledge of the intentions of other agents in the environment allow the learning agent to achieve its own goals in a much more efficient way.", "Compositionality  Compositionality is the classic idea that new representations can be constructed through the combination of primitive elements.", "See Lake et.", "all 2015 for a discussion on the use of compositionality to generate novel handwritten characters.", "This is central to training agents to learn models of complex symbolic concepts.", "Learning-to-Learn  Learning-to-learn is closely related to the concept of \u201ctransfer-learning\u201d and \u201crepresentation-learning\u201d in machine learning.", "Machines that learn like humans will need to be able to learn rich, informative priors and models of the world that can be applied to a variety of tasks.", "Systems should be able to learn to do new tasks as flexibly and rapidly as humans do.", "The authors suggest compositionality and the use of causal models to augment the current deep-learning research in transfer-learning.", "Thinking fast  There are still a lot of challenges concerning intractability of certain methods and the amount of time necessary for doing optimization over high-dimensional potentially non-convex parameter spaces.", "Approximate inference is an area of research that aims to address these challenges.", "Monte Carlo methods are promising for many problems, but runs into problems when the hypothesis space is vast.", "Deep neural networks may potentially be used for performing probabilistic inference in a generative model or a probabilistic program.", "Dangers of model-free RL  There is evidence that the brain uses a form of model-free reinforcement learning to accomplish certain tasks.", "However, there is also evidence that the brain has a model-based learning system.", "Shifting between model-free and model-based learning methods can benefit from taking advantage of the causal-model/compositionality discussed above.", "Current model-free methods, as seen in DQN, Google DeepMind\u2019s Atari agent, are severely limited when it comes to generalizing beyond a certain amount.", "For example, the DQN agent would need significant re-training to be able to play a game whose screen was locked to a different resolution, and it would fail to play a game that required a working memory of game states/frames from the past (i.e. the agent would be missing causal information that coudl explain what is happening at the current state of the game).", "Strengths  The authors address potential counter-arguments in Section 5.", "They are: \u201cComparing the learning speeds of humans and neural networks on specific tasks is not meaningful, because humans have extensive prior experience\u201d, \u201cBiological plausibility suggests theories of intelligence should start with networks\u201d, \u201cLanguage is essential for human intelligence.", "Why is it not more prominent here?\u201d  Weaknesses  There isn\u2019t a clear definition of \u201cintelligence\u201d stated in the article.", "The closest is the authors\u2019 statement that the goal of those who wish to create machines that learn like humans (e.g. display human-level intelligence) should be to devise ways to carry out learning from far less data and to generalize in richer and more flexible ways."], "author_id": "pemami", "pdf_url":
