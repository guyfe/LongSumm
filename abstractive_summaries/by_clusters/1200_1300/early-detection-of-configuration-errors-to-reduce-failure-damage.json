the second part introduces a tool called PCheck, which if your program is written in C or Java can even find latent configuration usage and automatically write tests for you!", "Latent configuration errors can result in severe failures, as they are often associated with configurations used to control critical situations such as fail-over, error handling, backup, load balancing, mirroring, etc\u2026 Their detection or exposure is often too late to limit the failure damage.", "In a study of real-world configuration issues in the the products of COMP-A, \u201cmajor storage company in the US,\u201d with footnote \u201cwe are required to keep the company and its products anonymous,\u201d it turns out that 75% of all high severity\u00a0 configuration-related errors are caused by latent configuration errors.", "It may well be that the authors are required to keep COMP-A anonymous, but I couldn\u2019t help noticing the author affiliations printed in big type on the front page.", "A more than fair chance that company is NetApp I would say!", "The authors also studied a number of real-world open-source systems (see table below), and inspected usage of all of their RAS-related configuration parameters.", "They looked at how many of those parameters were explicity checked vs simply being used when first required, yielding the results below:  Many of the studied RAS parameters do not have any special code for checking the correctness of their settings.", "Instead, the correctness is verified (implicitly) when the parameters\u2019 values are actually used in operations such as a file open call.", "Here\u2019s an example of a real-world latent configuration error in MapReduce:  And here are some other bugs found during the study, in the most recent versions of the software under inspection in (a) HDFS:  and (b), Apache httpd:  So we know that many configuration parameters aren\u2019t checked before usage.", "It\u2019s also the case that many of these parameters aren\u2019t used during system startup (and so are not verified even implicitily):  Many (12-38.6%) of the studied RAS configuration parameters are not used at all during the system\u2019s initialization phase.", "Put these two finding together, and what you have is a collection of ticking time bombs!", "Remember that since these are configuration settings they may be changed on deployment \u2013 i.e. these are not bugs that unit testing can catch.", "4.7-38.6% of the studied RAS parameters do not have any early checks and and thereby subject to latent configuration errors which can cause severe impact on the system\u2019s dependability.", "Here\u2019s the summary of how many of these ticking time bombs can exist in the systems studied:  The threats are prevalent: Latent configuration errors can reside in 10+% of the RAS parameters in five out of six systems.", "As all theses latent configuration erros are discovered in the latest versions, any of them could appear in a real deployment and would impair the system\u2019s dependability in a latent fashion.", "The authors wrote a tool called PCheck which uses static code analysis to find instructions that load configuration parameters into program variables, looks for all instructions that use the parameter value, figures out the execution context of those instructions and composes checkers that can be run at initialization to verify the configurarion is well-formed in the target environment.", "I feel bad skipping over all of the details of the authors hard work here, but I\u2019m going to refer you to the paper for full details if you\u2019re interested.", "With the PCheck tests in place, the authors harvested 830 configuration files for the studied systems (from mailing lists and technical forums) and validated them.", "With the checks in place, 70+% of latent configuration errors were detected.", "PCheck reports 282 true configuration errors (from 830 configs!)", "and three false alarms.", "Many (37.5-87.8%) of the reported configuration erros can only be detected by considering the system\u2019s native execution environment.", "These configuration settings are valid in terms of format and syntax (in fact, they are likely to be correct in the original hosts).", "However, they are erroneous when used on the current system because the values violate environment constraints such as undefined environment variables, non-existing file-paths, unreachable IP addresses etc..  (Which leaves me a little unsure as to what the authors count as a \u2018true configuration error\u2019  \u2013 a configuration file which may have been perfectly valid on the system from which it was cut-and-pasted onto a mailing list may of course give problems in another context, but this doesn\u2019t imply it was truly a configuration error on the original system).", "Nevertheless, I think the overall message of this paper is clear: Ladies and Gentlemen, please eagerly check all of your configuration variables on system startup.", "This paper advocates early detection of configuration errors to minimize failure davage, especially in cloud and data-center systems.", "Despite all the efforts of validation, review, and testing, configuration errros (even those obvious errors) still cause many high-impact incidents of today\u2019s Internet and cloud systems."], "author_id": "ACOLYER", "pdf_url": "https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi16/osdi16-xu.pdf", "author_full_name": "Adrian Colyer", "source_website": "https://blog.acolyer.org/about/", "id": 96308075}
