an abstraction is a conceptual simplification because it expresses what is being done without specifying how it is done.", "What kinds of abstractions should we be on the lookout for?", "Abstractions of resources \u2013 modules that map the characteristics of an abstract resource into the real underlying resource or resources  Abstractions that hide data storage representations  Abstractions that limit information:  According to the third requirement for good modularizatio, the functions comprising a partition support only one abstraction and nothing more.", "Sometimes it is difficult to see that this restriction is being violated, or to recognize that the possibility for identification of another abstraction exists.", "One technique for simplification is to limit the amount of information which the functions in the partition need to know (or even have access to).", "One way to limit information is to introduce modules at a lower level, on which the higher-level module depends, which hide that knowledge.", "Abstractions that generalize a function or group of functions.", "\u201cSeparating such groups is a common technique in system implementation and is also useful for error avoidance, minimization of work, and standardization.\u201d  Abstractions that encapsulate areas likely to change  The design process proceeds iteratively as follows.", "First determine an initial set of abstractions which represent the eventual system behaviour in a very general way.", "Then establish the data and flow of control connections among the partitions.", "The second phase occurs concurrently with the first; as abstractions are proposed, their utility and practicality are immediately investigated\u2026 A partition has been adequately investigated when its connections with the rest of the system are known and when the designers are confident that they understand exactly what its effect on the system will be.", "Varying depths of analysis will be necessary to achieve this confidence.", "When do you start programming modules?", "There is a tendency to think of this as the era of the strict waterfall, but that\u2019s not what Liskov proposes:  It is not clear exactly how early structured programming of the system should begin\u2026 The best rule is probably to keep trying to write structured programs; failure will indicate that the system abstractions are not yet sufficiently understood and perhaps this exercise will shed some light on where more effort is needed or where other abstractions are required.", "Finally, a design can be considered \u2018finished\u2019 when the following criteria are met:  All major abstractions have been identified and partitions defined for them; the system resources have been distributed among the partitions and their positions in the hierararchy established.", "The system exists as a structured program\u2026 this consists of several components, but no component is likely to be completely defined.", "Rather each component is likely to use the names of lower-level components which are not yet defined.", "Sufficient information is available so that a skeleton of a user\u2019s guide to the system could be written.", "(This was an era of much simpler user interfaces remember)."], "author_id": "ACOLYER", "pdf_url": "https://valbonne-consulting.com/papers/classic/Liskov_72-Design_Methodology_for_Reliable_Software_Systems.pdf", "author_full_name": "Adrian Colyer", "source_website": "https://blog.acolyer.org/about/", "id": 74642936}
