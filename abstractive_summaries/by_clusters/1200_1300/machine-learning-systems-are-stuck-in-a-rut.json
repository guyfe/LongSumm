copying, rearranging, and materialising to memory two orders of magnitude more data than is strictly necessary.", "Challenges optimising whole programs  It might be hard to performance tune a single non-standard kernel, but full programs must typically evaluate a large graph of kernels.", "In order to make use of pre-optimised kernels, it\u2019s necessary to use one of a small number of parameter layouts that have been chosen ahead of time to be optimal in isolation.", "In practice there are so few choices of layout available that frameworks like XLA and TVM do not attempt a global layout assignment, and instead choose fixed layouts for expensive operators like convolution, then propagate those layouts locally through the operator graph inserting transposes where necessary.", "Similar considerations make it hard to experiment with different choices for quantised and  low-precision types.", "Whole program optimisations such as common sub-expression elimination are attractive for machine learning, but hard to exploit to the fullest extent with the current state-of-the-art: \u201cit seems likely that it will be necessary to architect machine learning frameworks with automatic optimizers in mind before it will be possible to make the best use of whole-program optimization.\u201c  Challenges evolving programming languages  Recall that back ends are structured around calls to large monolithic kernels.", "In this section we argue that this back-end design approach is slowing progress in the maintainability, debuggability, and expressiveness of programming models.", "Worse, the resulting brake on innovation in languages is in itself reducing the incentive for back-end developers to improve on the current situation.", "We saw one such example at the top of this piece: support for named dimensions.", "Another consequence is the choice of kernels or \u2018operators\u2019 as the dominant abstraction, with user programs in Python calling into operators written in terms of specific back-end languages and libraries.", "This tends to fix both the set of operators and also their interfaces.", "Breaking out of the rut  Our main concern is that the inflexibility of languages and back ends is a real brake on innovative research, that risks slowing progress in this very active field\u2026  How might we break out of the rut?", "Embrace language design including automatic differentiation, using purely named dimensions and kernels expressed within the language syntax  Support a back-end IR defining a graph of layout-agnostic general purpose loop nests  Use transformation passes over the IR to lower it to a concrete common sub-expression elimination strategy, with layouts for each materialised intermediate  Compilation passes that generate accelerator code given the lowered IR, with adequate code produced quickly and close to peak performance achievable after searching  At a high level, this reminds me a little of the approach taken by Musketeer ."], "author_id": "ACOLYER", "pdf_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3317550.3321441?download=true", "author_full_name": "Adrian Colyer", "source_website": "https://blog.acolyer.org/about/", "id": 13040160}
