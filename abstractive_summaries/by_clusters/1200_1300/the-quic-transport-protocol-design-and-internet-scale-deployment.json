Establishing a connection  QUIC combines the cryptographic and transport handshake into one round trip when setting up a secure transport connection.", "If a connection is successfully established the client can cache information about the origin it connected to.", "When reconnecting to the same origin this cached information can be used to establish an encrypted connection with no additional round trips.", "Data can be sent immediately after sending the client hello, without even needing to wait for the the server\u2019s reply (0-RTT).", "If the client\u2019s cached information becomes out of date, then this 0-RTT handshake falls back into the 1-RTT variant.", "Stream multiplexing  To avoid head-of-line blocking due to TCP\u2019s sequential delivery, QUIC supports multiple streams within a connection, ensuring that a lost UDP packet only impacts those streams whose data was carried in the packet.", "Streams are lightweight enough that a new stream can reasonably be used for each of a series of small messages.", "Loss recovery  In TCP, retransmitted segments carry the same sequence numbers as the original packet, which complicates ACKs.", "In QUIC, every packet carries a new sequence number, including those carrying retransmitted data.", "Stream offsets in stream frames are used for delivery ordering, separating the two functions [ordering and acknowledgement] that TCP conflates.", "The packet number represents an explicit time-ordering, which enables simpler and more accurate loss detection than in TCP.", "The separation also allows more accurate network RTT estimation helping delay-sensing congestion controllers such as BBR and PCC.", "Authentication and encryption  With the exception of the early handshake packets and reset packets, QUIC packets are fully authenticated and mostly encrypted, as shown below:  QUIC\u2019s cryptography provides two levels of secrecy: initial client data is encrypted using initial keys, and subsequent client data and all server data are encrypted using forward-secure keys.", "All of the information sent in the clear is also included in the derivation of the final connection keys \u2013 so any in network tampering will be detected and cause the connection to fail.", "Flow control  QUIC use stream-level flow control, in conjunction with an overall connection flow control mechanism.", "As in HTTP/2, the flow control mechanism is credit based:  A QUIC receiver advertises the absolute byte offset within each stream up to which the receiver is willing to receive data.", "As data is sent, received, and delivered on a particular stream, the receiver periodically sends window update frames that increase the advertised offset limit for that stream, allowing the peer to send more data on that stream.", "Congestion control  Congestion control in QUIC is pluggable.", "The initial implementation uses Cubic .", "How Google built and evolved QUIC  Our development of the QUIC protocol relies heavily on continual Internet-scale experimentation to examine the value of various features and to tune parameters\u2026 We drove QUIC experimentation by implementing it in Chrome, which has a strong experimentation and analysis framework that allows new features to be A/B tested and evaluated before full launch.", "QUIC was also able to directly link experiments into the analytics of the application services using QUIC connections.", "This enabled the team to quantify the end-to-end effect on user and application centric performance metrics.", "QUIC support in the YouTube and the Android Google Search apps was also able to take advantage of their respective experimentation frameworks.", "Through small but repeatable improvements and rapid iteration, the QUIC project has been able to establish and sustain an appreciable and steady trajectory of cumulative performance gains.", "Is QUIC actually quick?", "The table below shows the reductions in search and video latency achieved when using the QUIC protocol.", "The improvement mostly comes from reducing handshake latency.", "Users of QUIC also saw reduced playback interruptions due to rebuffering.", "This is due to QUIC\u2019s reduced loss-recovery latency.", "And here\u2019s how QUIC stands up against the TCP/TLS alternative:  The downside is that QUIC is currently twice as expensive as TCP/TLS in terms of CPU."], "author_id": "ACOLYER", "pdf_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3098822.3098842?download=true", "author_full_name": "Adrian Colyer", "source_website": "https://blog.acolyer.org/about/", "id": 81001972}
