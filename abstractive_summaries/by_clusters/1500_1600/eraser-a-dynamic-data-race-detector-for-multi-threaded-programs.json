One issue with Eraser is that it can create false alarms.", "These fall into three broad catagories:  Memory reuse:  if a program allocates its own memory blocks  and later on privately recycles them, Eraser has no way of knowing that the \u2018new\u2019 memory is now protected by a new set of locks.", "Private locks: using a locking mechanism other than pthreads, which the Eraser implementation described in the paper would then be unable to detect.", "Benign race: genuine races, but which do not affect the result of the program (some of these may be intentional)  Eraser introduced an annotation model to suppress unwanted warnings.", "Not implemented in Eraser, but a useful extension, is the ability to detect deadlocks.", "The paper gives us a sketch of how this can work:  A simple discipline that avoids deadlock is to choose a partial order among all locks and to program each thread so that whenever it holds more than one lock, it acquires them in ascending order.", "This discipline is similar to the locking discipline for avoiding data races: it is suitable for checking by dynamic monitoring, and it is easier to produce a test case that exposes a breach of the discipline than it is to produce a test case that actually causes a deadlock.", "A results of checking several programs with Eraser are reported \u2013 and as expected, it does a good job of flushing out bugs!", "A note on Valgrind  Today the most commonly used tool is arguably Valgrind, which implements data-race detection with DRD .", "This is what the Valgrind manual has to say on the topic:  There exist two different approaches for verifying the correctness of multithreaded programs at runtime.", "The approach of the so-called Eraser algorithm is to verify whether all shared memory accesses follow a consistent locking strategy.", "And the happens-before data race detectors verify directly whether all interthread memory accesses are ordered by synchronization operations.", "While the last approach is more complex to implement, and while it is more sensitive to OS scheduling, it is a general approach that works for all classes of multithreaded programs.", "An important advantage of happens-before data race detectors is that these do not report any false positives."], "author_id": "ACOLYER", "pdf_url": "http://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/cps210/spring06/papers/eraser.pdf", "author_full_name": "Adrian Colyer", "source_website": "https://blog.acolyer.org/about/", "id": 48141212}
