When s releases the lock, l stays resident centrally at the broker.", "l is now treated as a type 1 lock.", "If a lock held at the broker is not accessed for a long time, and the broker needs to save space, an LRU policy can be used to migrate type 1 locks back to the server owning the corresponding data item (becoming type 3).", "We use the following rule of thumb for declaring a lock to be of type 2 and migrating that lock to a server: If two consecutive requests for a given lock l (held at the broker) comes from the same server w, then the broker migrates lock l to server w. From that point on w treats l as its local lock, the lock locality of w is improved with this, since w does not need to contact the broker for l again.", "A type 2 lock can migrate back to the broker again if a request for it is received from some other server than the one it currently resides on.", "In this manner,  As the centralized authority for mediating access to data, the broker learns about the access patterns of transactions at runtime and manages the migration of locks to servers in a way that improves lock access locality.", "The lock broker, however, is oblivious to the state of the transactions, and the servers are the ultimate transaction managers.", "Transactions are initiated and executed by the servers distributedly after checking that all the locks are available at the server.", "Panopticon uses a form of two-phase locking to manage transactions.", "When a server initiates a distributed transaction, it requests all the locks it needs in a batch request sent to the broker.", "The broker orders the locks by data item ID so that all transactions always attempt to acquire locks in the same order (preventing deadlock).", "The broker works through the requested locks in order.", "If it already owns a lock, it forwards it to the requesting server.", "If the broker does not have the lock, it adds the requesting server\u2019s name to a request queue that the broker maintains for that lock, and forwards a request for the lock to the current owning server.", "When the lock becomes available, the broker forwards it to the server at the head of the queue.", "If the server initiating the transaction ultimately requires for example four locks \u2013 l1, l2, l3, and l4 in that order, it may be that at some point it holds locks 1,2, and 4.", "However lock l4 can be taken away from it at any point until the server has also acquired lock 3.", "Locks 1 & 2 are considered to be \u2018authoritatively owned\u2019 by the server and will never be stolen from it.", "After a transaction is finished, the server needs to unlock the data items, which means returning the locks back to the broker.", "In this phase we propose an optimization where the server lazy unlocks the locks.", "Lazy unlocking means that the locks are released locally, but not transmitted back to broker until \u03b4 time elapses, where \u03b4 is empirically determined.", "Lazy unlocking provides efficiency benefits for cases when the server needs to access the same data items used in the terminated transaction immediately in the next transaction.", "If a lazy-unlocked data item lock is requested in the meantime, it is immediately returned to the broker.", "In order to give more scalability and avoid bottlenecks when using extremely large number of servers and locks, we can employ a hierarchical composition of the brokers.", "For this we have k level-0 lock brokers each overseeing a cluster of servers and a top-level lock broker overseeing  these k lock brokers\u2026 Moreover, using hierarchical composition of brokers at different datacenters, the Panopticon system can provide a partial answer to the across-datacenter/WAN transactions problem.", "Providing an efficient and complete system for across-datacenter transactions remains part of our future work.", "Partition detection follows very simple rules, given that there is a central broker.", "If you can see the broker, you\u2019re in the main partition, and if you can\u2019t, you\u2019re not!", "Providing continued operation for data items locked by locks outside of the main partition is future work.", "Panopticon is built on top of Hazelcast, and compares favourably to the default distributed transaction protocol in Hazelcast.", "The tests use artificially generated workloads.", "It would be interesting to see how Panopticon performs with real workloads (in particular, the effectiveness of Panopticon is sensitive to the parameter Phist that determines how likely it is that a server uses the same objects in consecutive transactions \u2013 just how likely is this in real workloads with load balancing etc.?", "(genuine question on my part)).", "A few other things I\u2019m left wondering about as well: the prepare and commit phases still need to happen at every RM, even if the locks move around\u2026.", "what gets logged and where in the WAL?", "(Records normally hold information about locks held).", "How does recovery work?", "How do you prevent the broker from becoming a single point of failure?", "And if it isn\u2019t, do you have to run some kind of consensus protocol across multiple brokers\u2026?"], "author_id": "ACOLYER", "pdf_url": "http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/tech-reports/2014-06.pdf", "author_full_name": "Adrian Colyer", "source_website": "https://blog.acolyer.org/about/", "id": 63188694}
