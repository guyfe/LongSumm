Jaffe proved that it was impossible to create a distributed algorithm that converged to this operation point.", "Jaffe\u2019s result rests on fundamental measurement ambiguities.", "Although it is impossible to disambiguate any single measurement, a connection\u2019s behavior over time tells a clearer story, suggesting the possibility of measurement strategies designed to resolve ambiguity.", "Introducing BBR  BBR is a congestion control algorithm based on these two parameters that fundamentally characterise a path: bottleneck bandwidth and round-trip propagation time.", "It makes continuous estimates of these values, resulting in a distributed congestion control algorithm that reacts to actual congestion, not packet loss or transient queue delay, and converges with high probability to Kleinrock\u2019s optimal operating point.", "(BBR is a simple instance of a Max-plus control system , a new approach to control based on nonstandard algebra.", "This approach allows the adaptation rate [controlled by the max gain] to be independent of the queue growth [controlled by the average gain].", "Applied to this problem, it results in a simple, implicit control loop where the adaptation to physical constraint changes is automatically handled by the filters representing those constraints.", "A conventional control system would require multiple loops connected by a complex state machine to accomplish the same result.)", "Since RTT can never be less than RTprop, tracking the minimum RTT provides an unbiased and efficient estimator of the round-trip propagation time.", "The existing TCP acks provide enough information for us to calculate RTT.", "Unlike RTT, nothing in the TCP spec requires implementations to track bottleneck bandwidth, but a good estimate results from tracking delivery rate.", "The average delivery rate between a send and an ack is simply the amount of data delivered divided by the time taken.", "We know that this must be less than the true bottleneck delivery rate, so we can use the highest recorded delivery rate as our running estimate of bandwidth bottleneck.", "Putting this altogether leads to a core BBR algorithm with two parts: a protocol to follow on receiving an ack, and a protocol to following when sending.", "You\u2019ll find the pseudocode for these on pages 28 and 29-30.", "From my reading, there are a couple of small mistakes in the pseudocode (but I could be mistaken!", "), so I\u2019ve recreated clean versions below.", "Please do check against those in the original article if you\u2019re digging deeper\u2026  Here\u2019s the ack protocol:  (app_limited_until is set on the sending side, when the app is not sending enough data to reach BDP).", "This is what the sending protocol looks like:  The pacing_gain controls how fast packets are sent relative to BtlBw and is key to BBR\u2019s ability to learn.", "A pacing_gain greater than 1 increases inflight and decreases packet inter-arrival time, moving the connection to the right on the performance charts.", "A pacing_gain less than 1 has the opposite effect, moving the connection to the left.", "BBR uses this pacing_gain to implement a simple sequential probing state machine that alternates between testing for higher bandwidths and then testing for lower round-trip times.", "The frequency, magnitude, duration and structure of these experiments differ depending on what\u2019s already known (start-up or steady state) and the sending app\u2019s behaviour (intermittent or continuous).", "Most time is spent in the ProbeBW state probing bandwidth.", "BBR cycles through a sequence of gains for pacing_gain, using an eight-phase cycle with values 5/4, 3/4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.", "Each phase lasts for the estimated round-trip propagation time.", "This design allows the gain cycle first to probe for more bandwidth with a pacing_gain above 1.0, then drain any resulting queue with a pacing_gain an equal distance below 1.0, and then cruise with a short queue using a pacing_gain of 1.0.", "The result is a control loop that looks like this plot below showing the RTT (blue), inflight (green) and delivery rate (red) from 700ms of a 10Mbps, 40-ms flow.", "Here\u2019s how BBR compares to CUBIC during the first second of a 10 Mbps, 40-ms flow.", "(BBR in green, CUBIC in red).", "We talked about the BBR benefits in Google\u2019s high-speed WAN network (B4) and in YouTube in the introduction.", "It also has massive benefits for low bandwidth mobile subscriptions.", "More than half of the world\u2019s 7 billion mobile Internet subscriptions connect via 8-to 114-kbps 2.5 G systems, which suffer well-documented problems because of loss-based congestion control\u2019s buffer-filling propensities.", "The bottleneck link for these systems is usually between the SGSN (serving GPRS support node)18 and mobile device.", "SGSN software runs on a standard PC platform with ample memory, so there are frequently megabytes of buffer between the Internet and mobile device.", "Figure 10 [ below] compares (emulated) SGSN Internet-to-mobile delay for BBR and CUBIC."], "author_id": "ACOLYER", "pdf_url":
