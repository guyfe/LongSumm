This gives an indication of past performance, but we also want to be responsive to spikes.", "So the overall threshold is managed as follows:  The best cold age threshold is tracked for each 1 minute period, and the K-th percentile is used as the threshold for the next one (so we\u2019ll violate approximately 100-K% of the times under steady state conditions)  If jobs access more cold memory during the minute than the chosen K-th percentile then the best cold age threshold from the previous minute is used instead  Zswap is disabled for the first S seconds of job execution to avoid making decisions based on insufficient information.", "The system also collects per-job cold-page histograms for a given set of predefined cold age thresholds.", "These are used to perform offline analysis for potential memory savings under different cold-age thresholds.", "ML-based auto-tuning  To find optimal values for K and S, Google built a model for offline what-if explorations based on collected far-memory traces, that can model one week of an entire WSCs far memory behaviour in less than an hour.", "This model is used by a Gaussian Process (GP) Bandit machine learning model to guide the parameter search towards an optimal point with a minimal number of trials.", "The best parameter configuration found by this process is periodically deployed to the WSC with a carefully monitored phased rollout.", "The big advantage of the ML based approach is that it can continuously adapt to changes in the workload and WSC configuration without needing constant manual tuning.", "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of a GP Bandit for optimizing a WSC.", "Evaluation  The far memory system has been deployed in production since 2016.", "The following chart shows the change in cold memory coverage over that time, including the introduction of the autotuner which gave an additional 20% boost.", "Cold memory coverage varies over machine and time, but at the cluster level it remains stable.", "This enabled Google to convert zswap\u2019s cold memory coverage into lower memory provisioning, achieving a 4-5% reduction in DRAM CTO.", "\u201cThese savings are realized with no difference in performance SLIs.\u201d  There are very low promotion rates in practice, both before and after deployment of the autotuner.", "CPU overhead for compression and decompression is very low as well (0.001% and 0.005% respectively).", "One of the biggest consumers of DRAM is Bigtable, storing petabytes of data in memory and serving millions of operations per second.", "The following chart shows an A/B test result for Bigtable with and without zswap enabled.", "During this period site engineers monitored application-level performance metrics and observed no SLO violations.", "For Bigtable, zswap achieves 5-15% cold memory coverage.", "Our system has been in deployment in Google\u2019s WSC for several years and our results show that this far memory tier is very effective in saving memory CapEx costs without negatively impacting application performance\u2026 Ultimately an exciting end state would be one where the system uses both hardware and software approaches and multiple tiers of far memory (sub-\u00b5s tier-1 and single \u00b5s tier-2), all managed intelligently with machine learning and working harmoniously to address the DRAM scaling challenge."], "author_id": "ACOLYER", "pdf_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3297858.3304053?download=true", "author_full_name": "Adrian Colyer", "source_website": "https://blog.acolyer.org/about/", "id": 88655260}
