When encryption is  used only to bind parts of a message, signature is sufficient.", "The meaning attached  to this binding is rather protocol-dependent,  and often subtle.", "To produce random numbers?", "Principle 5  Don\u2019t confuse the fact that a party signed an encrypted message, with the fact that a party knows the content of an encrypted message\u2026  When a principal signs material that has already been encrypted, it should not be inferred that the principal knows the content  of the message.", "On the other hand, it is  proper to infer that the principal that signs  a message and then encrypts it for privacy  knows the content of the message.", "Principle 6  Be clear what properties you are assuming  about nonces.", "What may do for ensuring  temporal succession may not do for ensuring  association-and perhaps association is best  established by other means.", "Nonces are often used to avoid message replay attacks, as part of a challenge-response exchange.", "\u201cA message is sent which leads to a reply  which could only have been produced in knowl-edge of the first message.", "The objective is to  guarantee that the second message is made after  the first was sent, and sometimes to bind the two together.", "There is sometimes confusion about nonces-are they guaranteed new, random, unpredictable?\u201d  It is not necessary for nonces to be unpredictable (you could use a counter).", "However, predictable nonces should be used with caution.", "This leads to principle 7\u2026  Principle 7  The use of a predictable quantity (such as the value of a counter) can serve in  guaranteeing newness, through a challenge- response exchange.", "But if a predictable  quantity is to be effective, it should be protected so that an intruder cannot simulate a  challenge and later replay a response.", "Principle 8  If timestamps are used as freshness guarantees by reference to absolute time, then  the difference between local clocks at various machines must be much less than the  allowable age of a message deemed to be  valid.", "Furthermore, the time maintenance  mechanism everywhere becomes part of the  trusted computing base.", "Principle 9  A key may have been used recently, for ex-ample to encrypt a nonce, yet be quite old,  and possibly compromised.", "Recent use does  not make the key look any better than it  would otherwise.", "In other words, don\u2019t confuse recency of use with recency of generation.", "Principle 10  If an encoding is used to present the meaning of a message, then it should be possible  to tell which encoding is being used.", "In the  common case where the encoding is protocol  dependent, it should be possible to deduce  that the message belongs to this protocol,  and in fact to a particular run of the protocol, and to know its number in the protocol.", "If you choose to use a compact encoding, make sure there is no loss of information and no chance of confusing messages from different instances of the protocol.", "Principle 11  The final principle builds on the second one:  The protocol designer should know which trust relations his protocol depends on, and  why the dependence is necessary.", "The reasons for particular trust relations being acceptable should be explicit though they will  be founded on judgement and policy rather  than on logic.", "An example is given with respect to timestamps:  The use of timestamps makes explicit for the first  time a question of trust.", "When can a principal  A rely on another principal B putting a correct  timestamp in a message?", "The answer usually  given is that this is acceptable if A trusts B in  relation to timestamps\u2026  Which leads to the general rule\u2026  We may simply say that A trusts  B in regard to some function if a loss of security  to A could follow from B not behaving in the  specified way; it is usually difficult or impossible  for A to verify B\u2019s good behavior.", "There is some measure of trust involved whenever one principal acts on the content of a message from another.", "It is essential that this trust  be properly understood.", "See the full paper for a more detailed exposition of the principles, and for examples in each case of protocols that violated the principle and hence ended up in trouble."], "author_id": "ACOLYER", "pdf_url": "http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/courses/cs6431/prudent.pdf", "author_full_name": "Adrian Colyer", "source_website": "https://blog.acolyer.org/about/", "id": 97381495}
