customers\u2019 decisions Li et al., WSDM\u201919  The authors of this paper won round 9 of the Yelp dataset challenge for their work.", "The goal is to find new target customers for local businesses by mining location-based checkins of users, user preferences, and online reviews.", "Location-based social networks attract millions of users to share their social friendship and their locations via check-ins.", "For example, an average of 142 million users check in at local businesses via Yelp every month.", "Foursquare and 55 million monthly active users and 8 million daily check-ins on the Swarm application.", "Facebook Local, powered by 70 million businesses, facilitates the discovery of local events and places for over one billion active daily users.", "(And of course these are just the explicit check-ins, location tracking has proved tempting to many businesses without requiring explicit user checkin actions.", "For example: Facebook is tracking your phone\u2019s location\u2026 , Google\u2019s location history is still recording your every move\u2026 , Google tracks your movements, like it or not , \u2026).", "Check-ins give us a location history.", "Preference for a given business will be influenced by the proximity of that business to the places a given user frequents, in accordance with Tobler\u2019s first law of geography : \u201ceverything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.\u201d Which translates into:  \u2026 the propensity of a customer for a local business in inversely proportional to the distance between the customer and the business.", "It\u2019s not quite that straightforward though.", "Customers will be prepared to travel more or less far depending on the type of business.", "For example, customers at the Phoenix art museum travel farther to get there on average than customers at a McDonald\u2019s.", "For most people, their lives gravitate around two location centres (\u2018exploration centres\u2019): home and work:  This is what that looks like for two individual users:  In addition to location and their general preferences, customers are also increasingly influenced by reviews.", "A 2016 study by BrightLocal found that 92% of customers regularly or occasionally read online reviews, which help them judge the quality of services offered.", "\u2026 the impact of online reviews is non-negligible and growing.", "One of the interesting findings from the evaluation is that to a reasonable extent, \u201cyou\u2019re only as good as your last review!\u201d The chart below shows a big jump in MAP when including information from the most recent review, and only a marginal performance gain with additional reviews.", "This is mainly due to the fact that customers only read a few latest reviews to perceive the reputation of the local business.", "Anyway, we\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves\u2026  CORALS  CORALS is a customer recommendation model based on historical check-in information, which integrates customer personal preferences, geographical influence, and business reputation (reviews).", "These are modelled by:  , the preference of customer i for business b,  , the geographical convenience of business b for customer i  , the reliance of customer i on the reputation  of business b  The overall tendency of a customer to visit a given business is just a linear combination of these three factors:  .", "The probability that a given customer will check-in at a given business location is learned by a series of pairwise comparisons.", "Say we know that customer i has checked in at location b.", "Sample another customer j at random.", "If j has not checked in at location b, then intuitively it ought to be that the probability for i to check in at location b should be higher than the probability of j to check in there.", "The probability that customer i is more likely to visit a business b than customer j is denoted by  , with  representing the model parameters.", "It\u2019s just a linear combination of the same three factors, but this time looking at the distances between them (and then using the sigmoid function, represented by  in this case, to turn the sum into a probability).", "The overall model is constructed by maximising over all observed and sampled checkins:  where  models the parameters  with a Gaussian prior.", "Optimisation proceeds as follows.", "First the parameters  are initialised using the normal distribution.", "Then we iterate for a fixed number of iterations, performing  the following steps in each iteration:  For each observed check in (b, i),  sample random customers j who have not visited b, making up to $latex s_{max} attempts to find a _j_ such that the preference order between _i_ and _j_ is _not_

vectors, word and sentence embeddings are used to turn review text into a vector.", "The n most recent reviews are used to form the final reputation vector, with n = 1 being the default.", "(Because ratings on a 0-5 scale weren\u2019t available?", "I presume so.", "Someone must have studied the relative influence of words and rating numbers in online reviews\u2026 this infographic from Vendasta
