once the root attribute is chosen, the succeeding examples will be passed down to the corresponding leaves and used to choose the appropriate attributes there, and so on recursively.", "We solve the difficult problem of deciding exactly how many examples are necessary at each node by using a statistical result known as the Hoeffding bound (or additive Chernoff bound).", "Given a real-valued random variable r with range R (e.g. 0-1 for a probability), and n independent observations of the variable, we can compute the mean of those observations, r\u0304.", "The Hoeffding bound tells us that with probability 1 \u2013 \u03b4, the true mean of the variable is at least r\u0304 \u2013 \u03b5, where:  The Hoeffding bound has the very attractive property that it is independent of the probability distribution generating the observations.", "The price of this generality is that the bound is more conservative than distribution-dependent ones (i.e., it will take more observations to reach the same \u03b4 and \u03b5).", "If G(Xi) is the heuristic used to choose test attributes, then we want to ensure with high probability the attribute chosen using n examples (where n is as small as possible) is the same that would be chosen using infinite examples.", "Suppose that we\u2019ve seen n examples so far, and the best attribute predicted by G is Xa and the second best is Xb.", "Call the difference between the observed heuristic values of Xa and Xb \u0394G\u0304  Now, given a desired \u03b4, the Hoeffding bound tells us that Xa is the correct choice with probability 1 \u2013 \u03b4 if n examples have been seen at this node and \u0394G\u0304 > \u03b52.", "Thus a node needs to accumulate examples from the streamuntil \u03b5 becomes smaller than \u2206G.", "(Notice that \u03b5 is a monotonically decreasing function of n.) At this point the node can be split using the current best attribute, and succeeding examples will be passed to the new leaves.", "Pseudo-code for a Hoeffding tree algorithm based on this is given in table 1 of the paper.", "The VFDT system was built using this algorithm, and included a number of additional optimisations:  When two or more attributes have very similar scores, lots of examples may be needed to decide between them with confidence.", "But if they are very similar, it probably doesn\u2019t matter too much which one we choose, so let\u2019s just pick one after we reach some user-defined threshold and move on\u2026  We don\u2019t need to recompute G after every example since it is unlikely the decision to split will be made at that specific point.", "So we can micro-batch and accept a minimum number of new examples before recomputing G.  Under memory pressure, VFDT deactivates the least promising leaves in order to make room for new ones.", "Likewise VFDT can also drop early on attributes that do not look promising.", "VFDT can be initialised with a tree produced offline by a traditional batch learner.", "(Trained on a subset of the overall data).", "VFDT can rescan previously seen examples if desired.", "This option can be activated if either the data arrives slowly enough that there is time for it, or if the dataset is finite and small enough that it is feasible to scan it multiple times.", "This means that VFDT need never grow a smaller (and potentially less accurate) tree than other algorithms because of using each example only once."], "author_id": "ACOLYER", "pdf_url": "http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/kdd00.pdf", "author_full_name": "Adrian Colyer", "source_website": "https://blog.acolyer.org/about/", "id": 4830217}
