A popular way for developers to enable users to detect accidental or intentional modifications of their program files hosted on external platforms, such as mirrors and CDNs, is to provide so-called checksums on their websites.", "This practice is quite common in the open-source community but also for companies such as Google\u2026  For a restricted subset of downloadable assets -chiefly JavaScript and style sheets, included via script and link tags, integrated checksum support is available via the Subresource Integrity (SRI) specification introduced by the W3C in 2016.", "It\u2019s supported by all major browsers (including Edge, but not IE).", "If you\u2019re not already using it for externally hosted assets you include in your site then you really should look into it.", "Here\u2019s an example of the integrity attribute in action, taken from the MDN site:  <script src=\" [url]"], "author_id": "ACOLYER", "pdf_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3243734.3243746?download=true", "author_full_name": "Adrian Colyer", "source_website": "https://blog.acolyer.org/about/", "id": 57228237}
