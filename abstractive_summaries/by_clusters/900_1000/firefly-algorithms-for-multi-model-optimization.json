When \u03b3 \u2192 0 we have the situation where light intensity does not decrease with distance in an idealized sky, and this corresponds to Particle Swarm Optimisation .", "When \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e we have \u2018very shortsighted fireflies\u2019 !", "This corresponds to the completely random search method.", "As the firefly algorithm is usually in somewhere between these two extremes, it is possible to adjust the parameter \u03b3 and \u03b1 so that it can outperform both the random search and PSO.", "In fact, FA can find the global optima as well as all the local optima simultaneously in a very effective manner\u2026.", "Our simulation results for finding the global optima of various test functions suggest that particle swarm often outperforms traditional algorithms such as genetic algorithms, while the new firefly algorithm is superior to both PSO and GA in terms of both efficiency and success rate.", "This implies that FA is potentially more powerful in solving NP-hard problems which will be investigated further in future studies."], "author_id": "ACOLYER", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.1466v1.pdf", "author_full_name": "Adrian Colyer", "source_website": "https://blog.acolyer.org/about/", "id": 97703387}
