and above 16 threads although cLSM performs much better than the others, its absolute gains in throughput are relatively modest.", "You can also just start to see a nice curve as predicted but the USL in the cLSM throughput numbers.", "More convincing is the data from the evaluation of workloads logged in production by a key-value store supporting \u2018some of the major personalized content and advertising systems on the web.\u2019 See figure 10 from the paper, reproduced below:  cLSM also manages to maintain lower latency numbers than the competition as throughput scales.", "How is it done?", "First off, the in-memory component of the LSM tree is replaced by a \u2018thread-safe map data structure.\u2019  We assume a thread-safe map data structure for the in- memory component, i.e., its operations can be executed by multiple threads concurrently.", "Numerous data structure implementations, provide this functionality in a non-blocking and atomic manner.", "This is then integrated into the normal LSM merge operation.", "Snapshot scans are implemented on top of the in-memory map on the assumption that the map provides iterators with weak consistency (if an element is included in the map for the duration of the scan, it will be included in the scan results).", "Finally, an atomic read-modify-write operation is introduced:  We now introduce a general read-modify-write operation, RMW(k,f), which atomically applies an arbitrary function f to the current value v associated with key k and stores f(v) in its place.", "Such operations are useful for many applications, ranging from simple vector clock update and validation to implementing full-scale transactions.", "The implementation assumes a linked-list or derivative implementation type for the map structure.", "On this basis it uses optimistic concurrency control, and the contents of the prev and succ nodes in the chain to detect conflicts.", "At its heart though, the improvement seems to boil down to the simple idea of \u2018why don\u2019t we use an existing efficient in-memory structure for the in-memory part of the LSM-tree\u2019.", "That seems so simple and obvious (the benefit of hindsight perhaps?)", "that I\u2019m left with the nagging feeling maybe I\u2019m missing something here\u2026?"], "author_id": "ACOLYER", "pdf_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2741948.2741973?download=true", "author_full_name": "Adrian Colyer", "source_website": "https://blog.acolyer.org/about/", "id": 82821959}
