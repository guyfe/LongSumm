j < i, with i \u2208 C and j \u2209 C.  \u201cUnfortunately, this type of feedback is not suitable for standard machine learning algorithms.\u201d  Consider a search engine with an operational retrieval function f, and let rf(q) be the ranking returned by f for the query q.", "We want to evaluate how closely its ranking rf(q) approximates the optimal ordering r*.", "Kendall\u2019s \u03c4 is used for this, being the most frequently used measure in statistics for comparing the ordinal correlation of two random variables.", "Take two finite strict orderings over some set of documents D, ra and rb.", "Examine all pairs of documents d1 and d2 in D \u2013 if ra and rb agree on the relative ranking call (d1,d2) a concordant pair, otherwise if they disagree they are a discordant pair.", "Let P be the number of concordant pairs, and Q be the number of discordant pairs.", "Kendall\u2019s \u03c4 is simply the fraction of the total number of pairs that are concordant:  \u03c4(ra,rb) = (P \u2013 Q) / (P + Q)  We are now in a position to define the problem of learning a ranking function.", "For a fixed but unknown distribution Pr(q, r\u2217) of queries and target rankings on a document collection D with m documents, the goal is to learn a retrieval function f(q) for which the expected Kendall\u2019s \u03c4 is maximal.", "This turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the number of discordant pairs (Q).", "Unfortunately\u2026 this problem is NP-hard, but it is possible to approximate the solution.", "Joachims shows how to do this with a Support Vector Machine.", "My SVM-fu isn\u2019t up to giving any meaningful analysis of the way this is done, so I\u2019ll just show you where Joachims ends up:  \u03b5i,j,k are the introduced approximation variables that makes the problem practical, and C is a parameter that enables the trading off of margin size against training error."], "author_id": "ACOLYER", "pdf_url": "http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/tj/publications/joachims_02c.pdf", "author_full_name": "Adrian Colyer", "source_website": "https://blog.acolyer.org/about/", "id": 82220044}
