then with constant resources and varying load (e.g.", "to simulate usage spikes); and finally varying both load and resources.", "The time-series results show that the self-adaptive application behaves as intended.", "The controller adapts the dimmer both to the available capacity and number of users as expected, and keeps the perceived latencies close to the setpoint.", "Moreover, the advantages that the brownout paradigm brings to previously non-adaptive applications can clearly be observed from the results.", "The paper includes a number of charts that show very significant improvements in the ability to continue serving user requests within the desired latency targets when the system is under stress.", "A word of caution though, they\u2019re not the easiest to interpret.", "\u2026self-adaptation through brownout can allow applications to support more users or run on fewer resources than their non-adaptive counterparts.", "Hence our proposition enables cloud applications to more robustly deal with unexpected peaks or unexpected failures, without requiring spare capacity.", "The work in this paper only considers a single server!", "There\u2019s an important extension for multiple servers, some much easier to follow charts, and a discussion on the implications for load balancing that we\u2019ll look at next time\u2026"], "author_id": "ACOLYER", "pdf_url": "http://www.martinamaggio.com/preprints/icse2014-preprint.pdf", "author_full_name": "Adrian Colyer", "source_website": "https://blog.acolyer.org/about/", "id": 41161677}
